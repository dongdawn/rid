# Rid-kit

## Introduction

Rid-kit is a python package for enhanced sampling via RiD(Reinforced Dynamics) method.

## Installation

#### Environment installation

1, Install python and tensorflow (version<=1.15)

2, Install tensorflow's C++ interface
The tensorflow's C++ interface will be compiled from the source code, can be found [here](https://github.com/deepmodeling/deepmd-kit/blob/master/doc/install-tf.1.8.md).

3, Install plumed2.5.2

```bash
tar -xvzf plumed-2.5.2.tgz
cp DeePFE.cpp plumed-2.5.2/src/bias
tf_path=$tensorflow_root
CXXFLAGS="-std=gnu++11 -I $tf_path/include/" LDFLAGS=" -L$tf_path/lib -ltensorflow_framework -ltensorflow_cc -Wl,-rpath,$tf_path/lib/" ./configure --prefix=/software/plumed252 CC=mpicc CXX=mpicxx
```
Set the bashrc
```bash
source /software/plumed-2.5.2/sourceme.sh
export PLUMED2_HOME=/software/plumed252
export PATH=$PLUMED2_HOME/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PLUMED2_HOME/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PLUMED2_HOME/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH
export PLUMED_VIMPATH=$PLUMED2_HOME/vim:$PLUMED_VIMPATH
export INCLUDE=$PLUMED2_HOME/include:$INCLUDE
export PLUMED_KERNEL=/home/dongdong/software/plumed252/lib/libplumedKernel.so
```

4, Install gromacs 2019.2

```bash
tar -xzvf gromacs-2019.2.tar.gz
cd gromacs-2019.2
plumed patch -p
mkdir build
cd build
/software/cmake312/bin/cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/software/GMX20192plumed -DGMX_BUILD_OWN_FFTW=ON -DGMX_GPU=on -DGMX_SIMD=avx_256 -DGMX_PREFER_STATIC_LIBS=ON -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DGMX_EXTERNAL_BLAS=off
make -j 4
make install
```
Set the bashrc
```bash
source /software/GMX20192plumed/bin/GMXRC.bash
```

5, Install dpdispatcher
```
git clone https://github.com/deepmodeling/dpdispatcher.git
cd dpdispatcher
python setup.py install
```
dpdispatcher is a tool for job submitting.


Now you have all dependence of RiD (Gromacs, Tensorflow and a conda environment).
~~~bash
cd rit-kit
python setup.py install
~~~
Open python, try `import rid`.

Installation finishs successfully if you get no error.

## Quick Start
We offer a simple but complete example in `rid-kit/examples`

Try:
```bash
cd examples
python main.py rid.json -c cv.json -s machine.json -i ./mol -o ./test_examples 
```

To begin with, you should offer a rid parameters file(rid.json), a CV file(cv.json), a machine configuration file(machine.json) and a folder(mol/) containing initial conformation files in detail, and the number of conformation files should be equal to the number of walkers for parallel.

All these files are presented in `examples` folder where the users can adjust the parameter as their will.

The process of running will be recorded in `(work_path)/recoord.txt` in which its iteration index and task index will be written after finishing every task. If you want to rerun the process and make sure that a record file exists in the work path, the program will restart from the next one of the end of the record(just use the same command to resatrt). If a task was restarted, but a working folder (which this task should generate) has already existed, this existed folder will be backed off as `folder_name.bk00`. That is, you can restart the process at any individual task node through modifying the recording file.

However, if there is NOT a record file in the working path, the whole process will restrat at the very beginning. The old one will become a back-up folder as `old_folder.bk000`.

### CV selection
In this version, the user can choose the dihedral angles as CVs. rid-kit will remove the dihedral angles of the end of the proteins automatically. In the CV file(`cv.json`), the user can write the index of the selected residues, the two dihedral angle ($\psi$ and $\phi$) will be both setted as the CV. 

Plumed will output all selected angles in every md process, the user can find them in `work_path/iter.0000xx/00.enhcMD/00x/plm.out`, file `angle.rad.out` in the same path is a copy but removing the frame index.

We will add more features for users to select more different (and customed) CVs.

## Main procedure of RiD

RiD will run in iterations. Every iteration contains tasks below:

1. Biased MD;
2. Restrained MD;
3. Training neuro network.

#### a. Biased MD

Just like Metadynamics, RiD will sample based on a bias potential given by NN models. A uncertainty indicator will direct the process of adding bias potential.

#### b. Restrained MD

This procedure will calculate mean force based on the sampling results, which can generate data set for training. 

#### c. Neuro network training

A fully connected NN will be trained via sampling data. This network will generate a map from selected CV to free energy.
